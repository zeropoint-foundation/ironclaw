# Git Commit Workflow

When the user asks to create a commit:

1. Run `shell` with `git status` to see what files are staged and unstaged.
2. Run `shell` with `git diff --cached` to see the exact changes that will be committed.
3. Run `shell` with `git log --oneline -5` to understand the repo's commit message style.
4. Analyze the staged changes and draft a commit message:
   - Summarize the nature of the change (new feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.)
   - Keep it concise: 1-2 sentences focusing on **why**, not **what**
   - Match the repo's existing commit message style
5. **Do not commit files that likely contain secrets** (`.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys). Warn the user if such files are staged.
6. Show the proposed commit message to the user and **ask for confirmation** before running `git commit`.
7. Stage any requested files with `git add <specific files>` (never use `git add -A` or `git add .`).

## Commit Message Format

If the repo doesn't have a clear style, use:
```
<type>: <concise description>

<optional body explaining why>
```

Where type is: fix, feat, refactor, test, docs, chore.
